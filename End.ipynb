    "- IDE is the tool you use to develop your Selenium test cases.\n",
    "-  It’s an easy-to-use Chrome and Firefox extension and is generally the most efficient way to develop test cases.\n",
    "- It records the users’ actions in the browser for you, using existing Selenium commands.\n",
    "- If you want to create more advanced test cases, you will need to use either Selenium RC or WebDriver\n",
    "#### <font color=lightblue > Grid </font>\n",
    "- Grid is a part of the Selenium that specializes in running multiple tests across different browsers, operating systems, and machines in parallel.\n",
    "- It is achieved by routing the commands of remote browser instances where a server acts as a hub. A user needs to configure the remote server in order to execute the tests.\n",
    "#### <font color=lightblue > RC (Remotr Control) </font>\n",
    "- Selenium RC was the flagship testing framework of the whole Selenium project for a long time. This is the first automated web testing tool that allows users to use a programming language they prefer.\n",
    "- It supports several programming languages like C#, Java, Perl, Ruby, PHP, Python."
